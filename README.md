# moss-painter
Prototype Unity tool to paint moss geometry on top of scene geometry built in a few hours.

Seriously, just a proof of concept: it's cool for what it is but lacks the stability and optimization of a real tool, just like the rest of my tools

## Features
* Paint geometry on any static surface in a scene
* Perfect for low poly scenes :)) Terrible for high poly scenes :))
* Inflates moss to be on top of static meshes
* Put some effort into optimization

## To Do
* Fix erasing (It literally doesn't work lol)
* Optimize inflation algorithm (Octrees?)
* Add mesh chunking support
* Add multi-color support
